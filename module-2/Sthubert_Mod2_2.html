        <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction and Bio</h2>

        <p class="intro">Hello everyone. I’m Isaac, and I’m excited to be joining this class for the semester. I transferred to Bellevue University from my local college here in Florida. I was born and raised in central Florida and have mostly traveled around the southern states like Texas, Georgia, and the Carolinas.</p>

        <p>I plan on going to Boston this year to visit some friends, and I'm excited about that. <span class="sentence">I don’t know much about Nebraska, the state in which this school is located, but I hope to visit for my graduation ceremony in the future.</span> Other than that, I’d love to travel outside the States, particularly in the Caribbean, where I have some family.</p>

        <p>My main hobbies include reading a lot of fiction, particularly historical fiction, and building PCs. As far as IT, I’ve only dabbled in things on the hardware side, such as building PCs and troubleshooting faulty hardware like storage hard drives. It’s always fun to take apart PC components to learn their functionality and put it all back together again.</p>

        <p>I’ve always been interested in programming and decided to switch my major to Software Development to pursue a career in DevOps engineering. I’m currently not too well-versed in coding. Stll, I’ve always been interested in basic web development and HTML, but never took the plunge into learning any coding language until now.</p>
